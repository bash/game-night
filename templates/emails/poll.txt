This is a special game night just for members of Â«{{group.name}}Â».

â€¦ and I need *you* to help pick a date.
You can choose from the following dates:
{% for option in sorted_options() %}
â€¢ {{option.starts_at | time("{date}")}} at {{option.starts_at | time("{time}")}}
{%- endfor %}

But don't take too longâ€”the poll is only open until {{poll.open_until | time("{date}")}} at {{poll.open_until | time("{time}")}} :)

â†’ Onwards to the poll! {{poll_uri}}
â†’ I want to skip the upcoming game nightâ€¦ {{skip_poll_uri}}
